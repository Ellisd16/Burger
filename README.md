# Burger App

## About

Create an App that allows users to make and eat any burger they name!

## Programs

Javascript, Node.js, Handlebars

-Express & MySql as well

## Issues

The app runs fairly well. The only local problem is that you have to refresh the page after devouring a burger. Other than that the app works fine. I did have a problem deploying it Heroku however, as I am present with an error. I'll still link the heroku below just in case I find the solution.
