# Burger App

## About

Create an App that allows users to make and eat any burger they name!

## Programs

Javascript, Node.js, Handlebars

-Express & MySql as well

## Deployment
The application runs on localhost using the programs listed above. As of right now, you are able to load the page, see all the listed burgers and edit the list! 

## Future Developments
I want to make the page run on Heroku like it does on local host, and maybe change some of the styling.
